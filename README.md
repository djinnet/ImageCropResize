# ImageCropResize
A tiny utility tool to crop and resize screenshots with saved presets!

My *second* ever published Github project! Wowee!

This tool was created because I was tired of opening Photoshop just to crop screenshots for my website.
I figured I could make a little utility tool that could take a screenshot from the clipboard, crop and resize using stored presets, then copy the new image to the clipboard. So I made this! 

The code is very messy and has lots of repetitive tidbits, but I'll refactor it in a few months to see how far along I've come with writing nicer code. I thought this project would be a lot harder and require more maths than it did but it wasn't that bad at all.
I did have plans to include a window that allowed the user to draw out the crop directly on the image instead of manually inputting the values, but decided to leave it out for now as it needed more planning to work smoothly. SO MANY EDGE CASES. Also maths. Ugh.
